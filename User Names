Block buyers from your listings
If you don't wish to sell to certain eBay members, you can put them on your blocked list. Members on that list will be unable to bid, buy, make an offer or send you messages on any of your listings until you remove them from the list. You can block up to 5,000 members.
To block a member, enter the member's username and click Submit. Separate usernames with a comma.
Please review the members that you have blocked from your listings at least once a year and decide if they still need to be blocked. If you donâ€™t need to block a member anymore, select and erase their username and click Submit to delete them from the list.
You can restore a past blocked buyer list by clicking on Restore list. Remember, you can only restore blocked buyers lists from 3 months prior to today. Inform the members so they can resume bidding on your items.
